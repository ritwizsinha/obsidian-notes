1. Complete Binary Tree: Adding a new node leads to increase of height.Number of nodes are: 2^(h + 1)
2. Full/Complete Binary Tree: When represented in an array then they don't leave a gap in between. Height of a complete binary tree is always logn.

#### Heap
Complete binary tree.
Insertion: Best: O(1) Worst O(logn)
Deletion: O(logn) (Random deletions not allowed)
